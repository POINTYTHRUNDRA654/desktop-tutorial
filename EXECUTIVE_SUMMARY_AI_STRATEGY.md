- **50% Faster Learning** - Beginners productive in days, not weeks

---

## 🚀 Top 5 Recommendations

### 1. **Context-Aware AI** (Highest Priority) ⭐⭐⭐
**The Problem:** AI doesn't understand where user is in the workflow

**The Solution:** 
- Detect workflow stage (modeling, rigging, animation, export, testing)
- Provide stage-specific guidance
- Suggest next steps proactively
- Warn about common mistakes for that stage

**Impact:** Users always know what to do next  
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**ROI:** Immediate value, foundation for everything else

---

### 2. **Real-Time Scene Analysis** (Quick Win) ⭐⭐⭐
**The Problem:** Users discover problems after hours of work

**The Solution:**
- Blender add-on that analyzes scene in real-time
- Validates FO4 standards (1.0 scale, 30 FPS, poly counts)
- Checks UV maps, materials, rigging as user works
- One-click fixes for common issues

**Impact:** Catch errors immediately, not after export  
**Effort:** 3-4 weeks  
**ROI:** Saves hours of debugging, prevents frustration

---

### 3. **Smart Export Wizard** (Game Changer) ⭐⭐⭐
**The Problem:** Export process is manual and error-prone

**The Solution:**
- Pre-export validation checklist
- AI chooses optimal export settings
- Post-export verification
- Quality score (0-100)
- Automatic fixes for common issues

**Impact:** Exports work first time  
**Effort:** 2-3 weeks  
**ROI:** "It just works" reliability

---

### 4. **Proactive Issue Prediction** (Innovation) ⭐⭐
**The Problem:** Problems discovered too late

**The Solution:**
- AI watches for anti-patterns
- Predicts "This will cause a crash"
- Warns before problems occur
- Suggests preventive fixes
- Learns from past issues

**Impact:** Prevent wasted work  
**Effort:** 3-4 weeks  
**ROI:** User confidence, fewer support requests

---

### 5. **Expanded Script Library** (Long-Term Value) ⭐⭐
**The Problem:** Only 2 basic Blender scripts currently

**The Solution:**
- Grow from 2 → 20+ scripts
- FO4 Standards Enforcer
- Smart Material Converter
- Animation Validator
- Batch Exporter
- UV Map Fixer
- Poly Count Optimizer
- And 14 more...

**Impact:** One-click automation for everything  
**Effort:** 4-6 weeks  
**ROI:** Consistent quality, huge time savings

---

## 💰 Business Value

### For Users
- **Time Saved:** 2-5 hours per asset
