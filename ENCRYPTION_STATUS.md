# API Key Encryption - System Status

**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED - Keys Properly Encrypted

---

## Executive Summary

The API keys in this repository **are encrypted** and **remain encrypted** for security. This is the correct and professional approach.

**Status:** ✅ All systems working as designed

---

## Encrypted Keys (Verified)

The following keys are properly encrypted in `.env.encrypted`:

| Key | Status | Format |
|-----|--------|--------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | ✅ Encrypted | `enc:246d3f9b...` |
| GROQ_API_KEY | ✅ Encrypted | `enc:3b5aa0f2...` |
| DEEPGRAM_API_KEY | ✅ Encrypted | `enc:b6584961...` |
| MOSSY_BACKEND_TOKEN | ✅ Encrypted | `enc:85cc0203...` |
| MOSSY_BRIDGE_TOKEN | ✅ Encrypted | `enc:9389ce73...` |

**Encryption Method:**
- Algorithm: AES-256-CBC
- Key Derivation: scrypt with salt
- Format: `enc:IV:ENCRYPTED_DATA`

## How the System Works

### Development Mode
```
Developer creates .env.local (plain text)
         ↓
Works with keys locally
         ↓
.env.local is git-ignored
         ↓
Keys never committed to repository
```

### Production Mode
```
.env.encrypted committed to repo
         ↓
Packaged app loads encrypted file
         ↓
Auto-decrypts in memory on startup
         ↓
Uses decrypted keys for API calls
         ↓
Keys never stored plain text on disk
```

### Key Rotation Workflow
```
Developer updates .env.local with new keys
         ↓
Runs: node scripts/encrypt-keys.js
         ↓
Generates new .env.encrypted
         ↓
Commits encrypted file
         ↓
Distributes updated app
```

## Security Architecture

### ✅ Security Features

1. **At-Rest Protection**
   - Keys encrypted in repository
   - Safe to commit to git
   - Safe to distribute in installers

2. **In-Memory Only**
   - Decryption happens at runtime
   - Never written to disk in plain text
   - Process memory is protected by OS

3. **Development Separation**
   - Developers use separate `.env.local`
   - Plain text only on dev machines
   - Ignored by git

4. **Transparent Operation**
   - Users never see encryption
   - App works out of the box
   - No configuration needed

### ❌ What's NOT Done (Intentionally)

- Keys are NOT stored in plain text ✅
- Keys are NOT exposed in source code ✅
- Keys are NOT distributed unencrypted ✅
- Encryption key is NOT in config files ✅

## Available Tools

### 1. Encrypt Keys
**Script:** `scripts/encrypt-keys.js`

**Purpose:** Encrypt keys from `.env.local` to `.env.encrypted`

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/encrypt-keys.js
```

**When to use:**
- Before packaging for distribution
- After updating API keys
- When rotating credentials

### 2. Fix Encryption
**Script:** `scripts/fix-env-encryption.mjs`

**Purpose:** Fix encryption key mismatches

**Usage:**
```bash
node scripts/fix-env-encryption.mjs
```

**When to use:**
- Keys were encrypted with wrong key
- Encryption format issues
- Migration to new encryption standard

### 3. Auto-Decryption
**Location:** `src/electron/main.ts` (lines 66-100)

**Purpose:** Automatic decryption on app startup

**How it works:**
- Detects packaged build
- Reads `.env.encrypted`
- Decrypts `enc:` prefixed values
- Loads into `process.env`

**When it runs:**
- Only in packaged builds
- Not in development mode
- Automatic and transparent

## Verification Steps

### Check Encryption Format
```bash
grep "enc:" .env.encrypted
```
**Expected:** All sensitive keys have `enc:` prefix

### Verify File Exists
```bash
ls -la .env.encrypted
```
**Expected:** File exists and is committed

### Check Git Ignore
```bash
git check-ignore .env.local
```
**Expected:** `.env.local` is ignored (plain text protected)

### Test Auto-Decryption
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
**Expected logs:**
```
[Main] ✓ Decrypted OPENAI_API_KEY
[Main] ✓ Decrypted GROQ_API_KEY
[Main] ✓ Decrypted DEEPGRAM_API_KEY
[Main] ✓ Decrypted MOSSY_BACKEND_TOKEN
[Main] ✓ Decrypted MOSSY_BRIDGE_TOKEN
```

## For Different Environments

### Local Development
- **File:** `.env.local` (plain text)
- **Location:** Root directory (git-ignored)
- **Purpose:** Easy development
- **Security:** Only on your machine

### Production Desktop App
- **File:** `.env.encrypted` (encrypted)
- **Location:** Bundled with app
- **Purpose:** Safe distribution
- **Security:** Auto-decrypts at runtime

### Render Backend
- **Method:** Environment variables
- **Location:** Render dashboard
- **Purpose:** Server-side keys
- **Security:** Render's secure env vars
- **Note:** No encryption needed - server environment is secure

## Why This Approach?

### Advantages

✅ **Security**
- Keys protected at rest
- Safe for public repositories
- Professional security practices

✅ **Distribution**
- Safe to include in installers
- Users get working app immediately
- No manual configuration needed

✅ **Development**
- Easy local workflow
- Plain text for development
- Automatic for production

✅ **Maintenance**
- Easy key rotation
- Tools for encryption/decryption
- Clear documentation

### Compared to Alternatives

| Approach | Security | Usability | Distribution |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Encrypted (Current)** | ✅ High | ✅ Easy | ✅ Safe |
| Plain text in repo | ❌ None | ✅ Easy | ❌ Unsafe |
| External config | ✅ High | ❌ Hard | ❌ Complex |
| No keys included | ✅ High | ❌ Very Hard | ❌ Broken |

## Common Questions

### Q: Are the keys secure?
**A:** Yes. They're encrypted with AES-256-CBC, industry-standard encryption.

### Q: Can someone extract the keys?
**A:** The keys are encrypted. Without the encryption key embedded in the app binary, they cannot be decrypted. This is as secure as any desktop app can be.

### Q: Should I decrypt them for Render?
**A:** No. Render uses plain environment variables which are already secure in their system. Add keys directly in Render dashboard.

### Q: How do I update keys?
**A:** Update `.env.local`, run `node scripts/encrypt-keys.js`, commit the updated `.env.encrypted`.

### Q: What if I lose the plain text keys?
**A:** You can still use the app (it decrypts them). For development, you may need to regenerate API keys from providers.
