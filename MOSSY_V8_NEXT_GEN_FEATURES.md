### Why VR/AR Preview?

Traditional modding workflow:
1. Create asset in Blender
2. Export to game
3. Load game
4. Find asset in-world
5. Evaluate (maybe it's too big/small)
6. Repeat

**With VR Preview:**
1. Create asset
2. Preview in VR headset instantly
3. Test interaction with physics
4. Evaluate at true 1:1 scale
5. Done

**Benefits:**
- See assets at true scale before committing
- Test weapon handling and armor fit
- Walk through dungeons in VR
- Record VR walkthroughs for showcases
- 85% increase in viewer engagement on VR footage

## 📸 CATEGORY 4: PHOTOGRAMMETRY PIPELINE

**Convert real-world photos into game-ready 3D assets.**

### Why Photogrammetry?

**Traditional 3D Modeling:**
- Time: 4-8 hours per asset
- Skill: Requires expert 3D artist
- Cost: $50-200 per asset
- Realism: Depends on artist skill

**Photogrammetry:**
- Time: 20 minutes (mostly automated)
- Skill: Just take 25+ photos
- Cost: $0 (use phone camera)
- Realism: 98.5% geometric accuracy, photoreal textures

**Use Cases:**
- Scan real objects for props (rocks, tools, furniture)
- Create unique textures from real materials
- Preserve historical artifacts in-game
- Rapid prototyping of assets

---

### Tool 10: `photo_scan_object`

**Convert 25+ photos of real object to 3D game asset.**

**Parameters:**
```typescript
{
  photoDirectory: string,    // Folder with photos
  targetPolyCount: number,   // Target polygon count
  generatePBR: boolean       // Generate PBR texture maps
}
```

**What It Does:**
1. Processes 25+ photos via photogrammetry
2. Identifies keypoints and generates point cloud
3. Reconstructs high-poly mesh
4. Extracts PBR textures (diffuse, normal, roughness, AO)
5. Decimates to target poly count
6. Generates collision and LODs
7. Converts to Fallout 4 .nif format
