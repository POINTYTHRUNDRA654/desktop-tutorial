# Git Recovery Guide — Reconnecting GitHub Desktop

If GitHub Desktop says **"the repository no longer exists"**, **"Sorry, I can't find any repository matching…"**, or you can't push/pull, follow these steps.

---

## "I have lots of changes but I can't push — and I can't pull either"

This is the most common situation.  It happens because:

- GitHub Actions automatically rebuilt the addon zips and committed them while you were working.
- Now **GitHub is ahead of you** (it has commits you don't have locally).
- GitHub Desktop refuses to push because your branch is behind.
- GitHub Desktop refuses to pull because you have uncommitted local changes.

**The fix — run `end_session.bat`.**  It now handles this automatically:

1. Commits your local changes.
2. Fetches the latest commits from GitHub.
3. Rebases your work on top (no data lost).
4. Pushes everything.

Just **double-click `end_session.bat`** in your repo folder.  You do not need to do anything else.

If you prefer to do it manually in Git Bash, run these three commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "session: save work"
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main
```

> **What if I see "CONFLICT" messages?**
> Git found lines that you and the CI both changed.  Open each conflicting file,
> look for the `<<<<<<< HEAD` / `>>>>>>> origin/main` markers, pick which version
> to keep, save the file, then run `git rebase --continue`.  Run `end_session.bat`
> again after that.

## "My push is taking forever (estimated an hour)"

A push should complete in seconds for this repo.  If it is taking much longer,
one of these is the cause:

### Cause 1 — Large AI model files accidentally staged

Common culprits: `.gguf`, `.pt`, `.pth`, `.ckpt`, `.safetensors`, `.onnx`, `.bin`
files.  The Mossy AI / Nemotron LLM model is typically a `.gguf` file that can be
**2–8 GB** on its own.  These files must never be committed to Git.

Check what git is about to send:

```bash
git diff --cached --stat
```

If you see huge files listed, remove them from the staging area **without deleting them**:

```bash
git rm --cached path/to/mossy-model.gguf
git rm --cached path/to/huge/model.pt
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

These file types are now excluded by `.gitignore` so they will not be staged again.

If git is already tracking the file (it shows up in `git ls-files`), run:

```bash
git rm --cached --force path/to/model.gguf
```

### Cause 2 — The remote URL is wrong

Run `fix_git_remote.bat` to reset the remote URL to the correct value, then try
pushing again.

## "Sorry, I can't find any repository matching…" / "Still can't locate it"

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT — Read this before trying anything else**
>
> The "Clone a repository" dialog has **three tabs** at the top:
> **GitHub.com** | **GitHub Enterprise** | **URL**
>
> **The GitHub.com tab will NEVER work for this repository.**
> Do NOT type the URL into the GitHub.com tab's search box — it always fails.
>
> You must click the word **URL** (the tab on the far right) to switch to the URL tab,
> and then paste the address into the URL tab's input box.

**Step-by-step — do exactly this:**

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**.
2. Click **File → Clone repository…**  (the "Clone a repository" dialog opens).
3. Look at the three tabs at the very top of the dialog:
   `GitHub.com` | `GitHub Enterprise` | `URL`
4. **Click the word `URL`** — the rightmost tab.  The dialog contents will change.
   *(If the dialog still shows a search box with "Filter your repositories", you are still
   on the GitHub.com tab — click `URL` again.)*
5. You should now see a single text field labelled
   **"Repository URL or GitHub username and repository"**.
6. Click inside that field and paste this URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/POINTYTHRUNDRA654/Blender-add-on..git
   ```
   *(There are two dots before `.git` — that is correct and intentional.)*
7. Set **Local path** to wherever you want the folder (e.g. `D:\Blender addon 2`).
8. Click **Clone**.

> **Why does this keep failing?**  This repository's name ends with a period (`Blender-add-on.`).
> The GitHub.com search tab cannot find it at all.  Even the URL tab sometimes strips the
> trailing period, which is why we add `.git` at the end — it moves the period away from
> the very end of the URL so it can never be stripped.  Both URLs point to the same
> repository; the `.git` form is just more reliable.

## Should I Just Delete Everything and Re-clone?

**Yes — if you can't push at all, a fresh clone is the safest and quickest fix.**

Steps for a clean re-clone to your desktop:

1. **Back up any local changes** you have not yet committed (copy them somewhere safe).
2. **Delete the broken local folder** on your desktop.
3. Open **GitHub Desktop** → **File → Clone repository…**
4. At the top of the dialog, click the **`URL`** tab (the rightmost tab — NOT the GitHub.com tab).
5. Paste into the URL field (with `.git` at the end — this prevents the trailing period from being stripped):
   ```
   https://github.com/POINTYTHRUNDRA654/Blender-add-on..git
   ```
6. Set the local path to wherever you want it (e.g. your Desktop).
7. Click **Clone**.

After cloning, re-apply any local edits you backed up in step 1.

## Why Does the Trailing Period Cause Problems?

This repository's name ends with a period (`Blender-add-on.`).
Windows and some Git clients handle trailing periods inconsistently, which can cause GitHub Desktop to lose its connection to the remote.

---

## Option A — Fix With the Included Script (Easiest)

1. Download **`fix_git_remote.bat`** from this repository (or find it in the folder on your desktop).
2. Copy it into the local repository folder on your desktop (the same folder that has `__init__.py` in it).
3. **Double-click** `fix_git_remote.bat`.
4. It will automatically reconnect the remote URL and open GitHub Desktop.

---

## Option B — Fix Manually in GitHub Desktop

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**.
2. Go to **File → Add local repository…**
3. Browse to the folder on your desktop that contains the add-on files.
4. Click **Add repository**.
   - If Desktop says it can't find it, click **"create a repository"** — but **don't** actually create one. Cancel, and try the next step.
5. Go to **Repository → Repository settings…**
6. In the **Remote** tab, set the **Primary remote URL** to:
   ```
   https://github.com/POINTYTHRUNDRA654/Blender-add-on..git
   ```
   *(The `.git` suffix prevents GitHub Desktop from stripping the trailing period.)*
7. Click **Save**.
8. Now click **Fetch origin**. Your local changes will NOT be overwritten — Git will let you merge or keep both.

---

## Option C — Fix With Git Bash / Command Prompt

Open **Git Bash** (or Command Prompt) inside your local repository folder and run:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/POINTYTHRUNDRA654/Blender-add-on..git
git fetch origin
git status
```

Then to safely pull without losing your local work:

```bash
# Stash your local changes first
git stash

# Pull the latest from GitHub
git pull origin main

# Re-apply your local changes on top
git stash pop
```

If you get merge conflicts after `git stash pop`, Git will mark them in the files — open each file and decide which lines to keep, then commit.

---

## Will Pulling Overwrite My Fixed Files?

**No — not automatically.** Git will:

- Keep your local changes as-is unless they conflict with the remote.
- If both you and the remote changed the *same line* of the same file, Git will ask you to resolve the conflict.
- If you changed different files than the remote, everything merges cleanly.

Using `git stash` before pulling (shown in Option C) is the safest way to protect your work.

---

## After Reconnecting

Once GitHub Desktop shows your repository again:

1. Click **Fetch origin** to download the latest state from GitHub.
2. Review the **Changes** tab to see what differs.
3. If you have local commits waiting, click **Push origin** to send them up.
4. If GitHub is ahead of you, click **Pull origin** to bring those changes down.
