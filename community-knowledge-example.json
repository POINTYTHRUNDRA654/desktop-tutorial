      "content": "1. Avoid OnUpdate() spam - use RegisterForSingleUpdate instead\n2. Cache property references at the start of functions\n3. Use arrays instead of multiple individual variables when possible\n4. Keep scripts small and focused on single responsibilities\n5. Unregister for events when no longer needed\n6. Use conditional compilation to remove debug code\n7. Prefer native Papyrus functions over custom implementations\n8. Minimize cross-script calls - they're expensive\n9. Use OnInit() wisely - it runs when save loads\n10. Test with performance monitoring enabled",

      "content": "When designing quests in the Creation Kit:\n\n- Use stage numbers in multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30...) to leave room for additions\n- Stage 0 is automatically set when quest starts\n- Stage 200+ traditionally used for quest completion\n- Stage 1000+ used for permanent shutdown stages\n- Use GetStage() conditionally in dialogue/scripts\n- SetStage() is one-way - you can't go backwards\n- Document your stage flow in comments\n- Keep stage scripts minimal - move complex logic to separate scripts\n- Test all branching paths thoroughly\n- Use aliases to reference objects, not direct references",

      "title": "Load Order Conflict Resolution Tips",
      "content": "Resolving mod conflicts effectively:\n\n1. FormID conflicts:\n   - Open both conflicting mods in xEdit\n   - Check which records overlap (red highlight)\n   - Decide which changes to keep\n   - Create a patch plugin with winning edits\n   - Load patch AFTER both conflicting mods\n\n2. Asset conflicts (meshes/textures):\n   - Later loading mod wins automatically\n   - Use BA2 archives or loose files strategically\n   - Check Data folder structure for duplicates\n   - Use mod managers to handle priorities\n\n3. Script conflicts:\n   - Can't be resolved via load order\n   - May require script patching or recompilation\n   - Check for event registration conflicts\n   - Some script conflicts are fatal - choose one mod\n\n4. Keywords and injected records:\n   - Generally safe to have multiple sources\n   - Last loaded wins for modifications\n   - Leveled lists need special merging\n\nAlways test in-game after resolving conflicts!",
