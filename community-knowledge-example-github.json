      "content": "Creating Rust Effects with Brushes:\n\n1. Base Layer: Orange/brown rust color (#B7410E)\n2. Brush Selection: Scattered/splatter brushes\n3. Technique:\n   - Large brush (200-400px) at 10% opacity\n   - Random rotation enabled\n   - Multiple passes for buildup\n   - Vary brush size between passes\n\n4. Advanced Weathering:\n   - Layer 1: Light surface rust (orange)\n   - Layer 2: Deep corrosion (dark brown)\n   - Layer 3: Flaking metal (gray/white)\n   - Use layer masks for control\n\n5. Fallout 4 Specifics:\n   - Rust collects at edges and seams\n   - More rust near ground level\n   - Apply to metal diffuse (_d) texture\n   - Reduce in specular map for matte rust areas",
