## First Launch & Setup

### What Happens When You Start Mossy

When you first launch Mossy, you'll see:

1. **Pip-Boy Style Boot Screen** (looks like Fallout's computer interface)
   - This is just for fun! It takes about 3-5 seconds
   - Shows "Initializing Systems" messages
   - You don't need to do anything here

2. **Onboarding Wizard** (Setup Assistant)
   - This will guide you through setting up Mossy
   - It takes about 3-5 minutes
   - Don't worry, you can change everything later!

### Onboarding Wizard - Step by Step

#### **Screen 1: Welcome & Language**

**What You'll See:**
- Welcome message
- Language dropdown menu
- "Next" button

**What to Do:**
1. Click the language dropdown (default is English)
2. Select your preferred language
3. Click "Next" button

**Beginner Tip:** Don't stress about the language choice - you can change it later in Settings!

---

#### **Screen 2: System Scan**

**What You'll See:**
- Progress bar scanning your computer
- List of detected modding tools
- Icons next to each tool (checkmark = found, X = not found)

**What's Happening:**
- Mossy is looking for modding tools on your computer like:
  - Creation Kit (Fallout 4's official mod editor)
  - xEdit (tool for editing game files)
  - Blender (3D modeling software)
  - NifSkope (tool for viewing 3D meshes)
  - LOOT (load order optimization tool)

**What to Do:**
- Just wait for the scan to complete (usually 10-20 seconds)
- Click "Next" when it's done

**Beginner Tip:** Don't worry if Mossy doesn't find all tools! You can install them later when you need them.

---

#### **Screen 3: Tool Approvals**

**What You'll See:**
- List of tools Mossy found
- Checkbox next to each tool
- Brief description of what each tool does
- "Select All" / "Deselect All" buttons
- "Next" button

**What to Do:**
1. Review the list of tools
2. **Important:** Check (✓) the boxes for tools you want Mossy to work with
3. Unchecked tools won't be monitored or integrated
4. Click "Next"

**What Each Checkbox Means:**
- **Checked:** Mossy will monitor when you're using this tool and provide context-specific help
- **Unchecked:** Mossy will ignore this tool

**Beginner Tip:** It's safe to check all boxes! This just means Mossy can help you when you use those tools.

**Why This Matters:** When Mossy knows you're using (for example) Blender, she can give you Blender-specific advice and catch common mistakes.

#### **Having a Conversation**

**Step 1: Start Voice Chat**
- Click the large microphone button
- It turns red = listening
- You'll see "Status: Listening..." text

**Step 2: Speak Your Question**
- Speak clearly and naturally
- Don't need to yell or talk slowly
- Example: "Mossy, how do I create a normal map?"

**Step 3: Wait for Mossy**
- Mossy detects when you stop talking (about 1 second of silence)
- Avatar turns purple = processing
- **Don't speak again yet!** Let Mossy process

**Step 4: Listen to Response**
- Avatar turns bright green = speaking
- Mossy speaks her answer
- You'll also see text of what she says (usually)

**Step 5: Continue Conversation**
- When Mossy finishes (avatar back to yellow/listening)
- You can ask another question
- Or say "That answers it, thanks!"

---

#### **Example Voice Conversation**

**You speak:**
```
"Hello Mossy, I'm new to modding and I want to create a custom weapon. 
 What should I do first?"
```

**Mossy responds (speaking):**
```
"Welcome, Architect! I'm excited to help with your first weapon mod. 
 To start, you'll need three things: the Creation Kit, a basic understanding 
 of weapon records, and a plan for your weapon's stats. Should I explain 
 each of these in detail?"
```

**You speak:**
```
"Yes, please explain each one."
```

**Mossy continues explaining...**

---

### Troubleshooting Voice Chat

#### **"Mossy can't hear me"**

**Check these:**
1. ✓ Microphone button is RED (listening)
2. ✓ Correct microphone selected in Settings
3. ✓ Microphone not muted in system settings
4. ✓ Microphone permissions granted to Mossy
5. ✓ Try speaking louder or closer to microphone

**How to test:**
- Open Settings
- Look for microphone level indicator (usually shows bars when you speak)
- If bars don't move, microphone isn't working

---

#### **"Mossy cuts me off while I'm talking"**

**Why this happens:** Silence detection triggers too fast

**Solutions:**
1. Speak more continuously (fewer long pauses)
2. If you need to pause, say "um" or "and" to keep it active
3. In Settings, look for "Silence Detection Threshold" (if available) and increase it

---

#### **"Mossy's voice is robotic"**

**Why:** You're using Browser TTS (built-in voices)

**Solution:** 
- Open Settings (⚙️)
- Change TTS Provider to OpenAI or ElevenLabs
- Note: Requires API key and may cost money
- See settings guide above for details

---

#### **"Voice chat is laggy/slow"**

**Why:** Usually internet connection or provider issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet speed
2. Try switching STT provider in Settings
3. If using cloud providers (Deepgram, OpenAI), try Browser (local processing)
4. Close other programs using internet

---

### Voice Chat vs Text Chat - When to Use Which

**Use Voice Chat When:**
- ✓ You want hands-free help while working
- ✓ You're doing something physical (testing in-game, etc.)
- ✓ You prefer talking over typing
- ✓ You want quick back-and-forth conversation

**Use Text Chat When:**
- ✓ You need to copy-paste code or error messages
- ✓ You're in a quiet place where you can't talk
- ✓ You want to save the conversation easily
- ✓ You need precise technical information you'll reference later
- ✓ Your internet is slow

**Beginner Tip:** Most people use Text Chat for technical stuff and Voice Chat for learning/questions!

### What The Auditor Checks - Detailed

#### **For ESP/ESM/ESL Files (Plugin Files):**

**Check 1: TES4 Header Validation**
- **What it is:** The first part of the file that identifies it as a Fallout 4 plugin
- **What's checked:** Correct format, version numbers, required fields
- **Why it matters:** Invalid header = game won't load your mod
- **Common issue:** File corruption, incorrect editing tool used

**Check 2: Record Count**
- **What it is:** How many "records" (items, NPCs, locations, etc.) are in the file
- **What's checked:** Count matches what's actually in the file
- **Why it matters:** Mismatch can cause crashes
- **Common issue:** Using old editing tools

**Check 3: File Size Limits**
- **What it is:** How big the plugin file is
- **What's checked:** Doesn't exceed Fallout 4 limits
- **Why it matters:** Game has a 4GB limit for plugin files
- **Common issue:** Adding too many records without creating new plugin

**Check 4: Master File Dependencies**
- **What it is:** Other plugins your mod needs to work
- **What's checked:** All master files are listed, paths are correct
- **Why it matters:** Missing masters = crash on load
- **Common issue:** Forgetting to list dependencies

**Check 5: FormID Conflicts**
- **What it is:** Unique IDs for every object in your mod
- **What's checked:** No duplicate IDs, IDs don't conflict with other mods
- **Why it matters:** Conflicts = objects overwrite each other
- **Common issue:** Two mods trying to change the same thing

---

#### **For NIF Files (Mesh/3D Model Files):**

**Check 1: Vertex Count**
- **What it is:** Number of points that make up the 3D model
- **What's checked:** Count is reasonable for performance
- **Why it matters:** Too many vertices = game lag
- **Recommended:** <10,000 for most objects, <50,000 for large structures
- **Common issue:** Not optimizing meshes after modeling

**Check 2: Triangle Count**
- **What it is:** Number of triangular faces on the model
- **What's checked:** Count is optimized
- **Why it matters:** More triangles = worse performance
- **Recommended:** <20,000 for most objects
- **Common issue:** High subdivision in Blender

**Check 3: Texture Path Validity**
- **What it is:** Where the game looks for texture files
- **What's checked:** Paths are correct, textures exist
- **Why it matters:** Missing textures = purple/missing textures in game
- **Common issue:** Absolute paths (C:\MyFolder\) instead of relative paths (Textures\)

**Check 4: Absolute Path Detection**
- **What it is:** Hard-coded paths specific to your computer
- **What's checked:** No paths like "C:\" or "D:\"
- **Why it matters:** Other users don't have your exact folder structure
- **Common issue:** Exporting from Blender without fixing paths
- **How to fix:** Use relative paths or "pack" textures into the mod

**Check 5: Collision Data**
- **What it is:** Invisible shapes that tell the game what's solid
- **What's checked:** Collision exists and is not overly complex
- **Why it matters:** No collision = player falls through object, too complex = performance issues
- **Common issue:** Forgetting to add collision or using visual mesh as collision

---

#### **For DDS Files (Texture Files):**

**Check 1: Format Compatibility**
- **What it is:** The compression format of the texture
- **What's checked:** Using Fallout 4 compatible formats (BC1, BC3, BC5, BC7)
- **Why it matters:** Wrong format = texture won't display or causes crashes
- **Recommended:** 
  - BC1 for diffuse (color) maps
  - BC3 for diffuse with transparency
  - BC5 for normal maps
  - BC7 for high-quality color

**Check 2: Resolution (Power-of-2)**
- **What it is:** Width and height of the texture in pixels
- **What's checked:** Both dimensions are powers of 2 (512, 1024, 2048, 4096)
- **Why it matters:** Non power-of-2 textures cause performance issues or don't load
- **Valid sizes:** 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048, 4096x4096
- **Also OK:** Non-square but still power-of-2, like 512x1024
- **Common issue:** Exporting 1000x1000 instead of 1024x1024

**Check 3: Mipmap Presence**
- **What it is:** Smaller versions of the texture for distant viewing
- **What's checked:** Mipmaps are generated
- **Why it matters:** No mipmaps = worse performance and visual quality
- **Beginner Tip:** Always generate mipmaps when saving DDS files!

**Check 4: Compression Type**
- **What it is:** How the texture data is compressed
- **What's checked:** Appropriate compression for texture type
- **Why it matters:** Wrong compression = worse quality or larger file size
- **Common issue:** Using BC1 for textures with transparency (need BC3)

**Check 5: File Size Optimization**
- **What it is:** How big the texture file is
- **What's checked:** Size is reasonable for resolution and quality
- **Why it matters:** Oversized textures waste disk space and memory
- **Recommended:** 4K texture shouldn't be >10MB
- **Common issue:** Not using compression, saving as PNG instead of DDS

### Common Auditor Issues and Solutions

#### **Issue: "Invalid TES4 Header"**

**What it means:** The plugin file's header is corrupted or malformed

**Causes:**
- Edited with wrong tool
- File corruption
- Saved incorrectly

**How to fix:**
1. Open in Creation Kit or xEdit
2. Re-save the file
3. If still broken, start over from backup

**How to avoid:** Always use proper mod editing tools (Creation Kit, xEdit)

---

#### **Issue: "Non-Power-of-2 Texture Resolution"**

**What it means:** Texture dimensions aren't 512, 1024, 2048, etc.

**Example:** 1000x1000 instead of 1024x1024

**How to fix:**
1. Open texture in GIMP/Photoshop/Mossy Image Suite
2. Resize to nearest power-of-2
   - 1000x1000 → 1024x1024
   - 1500x1500 → 2048x2048
3. Re-save as DDS with proper format

**Beginner Tip:** In Mossy Image Suite, use the resize tool - it auto-suggests correct sizes!

---

#### **Issue: "Absolute Path Detected in NIF"**

**What it means:** The 3D model file contains a path like "C:\Users\YourName\..."

**Why it's bad:** Other users don't have that exact path on their computer

**How to fix:**
1. Open NIF in NifSkope
2. Find texture path field
3. Change from: "C:\Users\Me\Desktop\Mods\Textures\myTexture.dds"
4. Change to: "Textures\MyMod\myTexture.dds" (relative path)
5. Save NIF file

**Beginner Tip:** Always use paths starting with "Textures\" or "Meshes\"

---

#### **Issue: "High Vertex Count: 150,000 vertices"**

**What it means:** The 3D model is too complex/detailed

**Why it's bad:** Causes lag, especially with many instances

**How to fix:**
1. Open model in Blender
2. Use "Decimate" modifier to reduce polygons
3. Or manually reduce detail in less visible areas
4. Re-export as NIF

**Target counts:**
- Small items (weapons, clutter): <5,000 vertices
- Medium (furniture, creatures): <15,000 vertices
- Large (buildings): <50,000 vertices

---

### Beginner Tips for The Auditor

**✅ DO:**
- Scan your files regularly (not just at the end)
- Fix errors (❌) before warnings (⚠️)
- Always backup before using Auto-Fix
- Ask Mossy about issues you don't understand
- Export reports to track your progress

**❌ DON'T:**
- Ignore errors - they will cause problems!
- Auto-fix everything without understanding what changed
- Delete files to "fix" issues (fix the actual problem instead)
- Skip warnings - many become errors later
- Scan while actively editing (save and close files first)

---

**Important:**  The Auditor is your best friend! It catches mistakes BEFORE you test in-game, saving you hours of troubleshooting.
