## First Launch & Setup

### What Happens When You Start Mossy

When you first launch Mossy, you'll see:

1. **Pip-Boy Style Boot Screen** (looks like Fallout's computer interface)
   - This is just for fun! It takes about 3-5 seconds
   - Shows "Initializing Systems" messages
   - You don't need to do anything here

2. **Onboarding Wizard** (Setup Assistant)
   - This will guide you through setting up Mossy
   - It takes about 3-5 minutes
   - Don't worry, you can change everything later!

### Onboarding Wizard - Step by Step

#### **Screen 1: Welcome & Language**

**What You'll See:**
- Welcome message
- Language dropdown menu
- "Next" button

**What to Do:**
1. Click the language dropdown (default is English)
2. Select your preferred language
3. Click "Next" button

**Beginner Tip:** Don't stress about the language choice - you can change it later in Settings!

---

#### **Screen 2: System Scan**

**What You'll See:**
- Progress bar scanning your computer
- List of detected modding tools
- Icons next to each tool (checkmark = found, X = not found)

**What's Happening:**
- Mossy is looking for modding tools on your computer like:
  - Creation Kit (Fallout 4's official mod editor)
  - xEdit (tool for editing game files)
  - Blender (3D modeling software)
  - NifSkope (tool for viewing 3D meshes)
  - LOOT (load order optimization tool)

**What to Do:**
- Just wait for the scan to complete (usually 10-20 seconds)
- Click "Next" when it's done

**Beginner Tip:** Don't worry if Mossy doesn't find all tools! You can install them later when you need them.

---

#### **Screen 3: Tool Approvals**

**What You'll See:**
- List of tools Mossy found
- Checkbox next to each tool
- Brief description of what each tool does
- "Select All" / "Deselect All" buttons
- "Next" button

**What to Do:**
1. Review the list of tools
2. **Important:** Check (✓) the boxes for tools you want Mossy to work with
3. Unchecked tools won't be monitored or integrated
4. Click "Next"

**What Each Checkbox Means:**
- **Checked:** Mossy will monitor when you're using this tool and provide context-specific help
- **Unchecked:** Mossy will ignore this tool

**Beginner Tip:** It's safe to check all boxes! This just means Mossy can help you when you use those tools.

**Why This Matters:** When Mossy knows you're using (for example) Blender, she can give you Blender-specific advice and catch common mistakes.

#### **Example Voice Conversation**

**You speak:**
```
"Hello Mossy, I'm new to modding and I want to create a custom weapon. 
 What should I do first?"
```

**Mossy responds (speaking):**
```
"Welcome, Architect! I'm excited to help with your first weapon mod. 
 To start, you'll need three things: the Creation Kit, a basic understanding 
 of weapon records, and a plan for your weapon's stats. Should I explain 
 each of these in detail?"
```

**You speak:**
```
"Yes, please explain each one."
```

**Mossy continues explaining...**

### Troubleshooting Voice Chat

#### **"Mossy can't hear me"**

**Check these:**
1. ✓ Microphone button is RED (listening)
2. ✓ Correct microphone selected in Settings
3. ✓ Microphone not muted in system settings
4. ✓ Microphone permissions granted to Mossy
5. ✓ Try speaking louder or closer to microphone

**How to test:**
- Open Settings
- Look for microphone level indicator (usually shows bars when you speak)
- If bars don't move, microphone isn't working

---

#### **"Mossy cuts me off while I'm talking"**

**Why this happens:** Silence detection triggers too fast

**Solutions:**
1. Speak more continuously (fewer long pauses)
2. If you need to pause, say "um" or "and" to keep it active
3. In Settings, look for "Silence Detection Threshold" (if available) and increase it

---

#### **"Mossy's voice is robotic"**

**Why:** You're using Browser TTS (built-in voices)

**Solution:** 
- Open Settings (⚙️)
- Change TTS Provider to OpenAI or ElevenLabs
- Note: Requires API key and may cost money
- See settings guide above for details

---

#### **"Voice chat is laggy/slow"**

**Why:** Usually internet connection or provider issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet speed
2. Try switching STT provider in Settings
3. If using cloud providers (Deepgram, OpenAI), try Browser (local processing)
4. Close other programs using internet

### Voice Chat vs Text Chat - When to Use Which

**Use Voice Chat When:**
- ✓ You want hands-free help while working
- ✓ You're doing something physical (testing in-game, etc.)
- ✓ You prefer talking over typing
- ✓ You want quick back-and-forth conversation

**Use Text Chat When:**
- ✓ You need to copy-paste code or error messages
- ✓ You're in a quiet place where you can't talk
- ✓ You want to save the conversation easily
- ✓ You need precise technical information you'll reference later
- ✓ Your internet is slow

**Beginner Tip:** Most people use Text Chat for technical stuff and Voice Chat for learning/questions!
