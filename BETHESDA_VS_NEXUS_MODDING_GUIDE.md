## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Console Players (Xbox/PlayStation)

**You MUST use Bethesda.net** - It's your only option.

**Tips for Console Modding:**
1. **Stay within limits**: Monitor your mod space carefully
2. **Read descriptions**: Console-specific notes matter
3. **Disable mods for achievements**: Or use achievement mods
4. **Regular clean slate**: Occasionally start fresh to avoid corruption
5. **Load order matters**: Heavy mods at bottom, patches at top

**Recommended Console Mod Types:**
- Quality of life improvements
- Weapon/armor additions
- Settlement enhancements
- Minor gameplay tweaks
- Bug fixes

**Avoid on Console:**
- Massive texture overhauls (size limits)
- Complex script-heavy mods (performance)
- Mods requiring external tools

### PC Players

**You can use BOTH platforms**, but here's the smart approach:

**Recommended Strategy:**
1. **Primary: Nexus Mods**
   - Use for main mod list
   - Install via Vortex or MO2
   - Leverage F4SE mods

2. **Supplement: Bethesda.net**
   - Only if mod isn't on Nexus
   - Simple mods that don't need mod manager
   - Console-exclusive ports

**Why prioritize Nexus on PC?**
- No artificial limitations
- Full mod manager support
- Better version control
- Larger mod selection
- Active community support

## Mod Author Perspective

### Publishing to Bethesda.net

**Requirements:**
- BA2 archive format
- Pass content guidelines
- Stay within size limits
- No external dependencies

**Advantages:**
- Reach console audience
- Built-in distribution
- Official platform

**Disadvantages:**
- Extra packaging work
- Size restrictions
- Content limitations
- Fewer tools

### Publishing to Nexus

**Requirements:**
- Create account
- Follow site rules
- Provide clear description

**Advantages:**
- No file size limits
- Flexible formats
- Better version control
- Active community
- Statistics and tracking

**Disadvantages:**
- PC only reach
- Need external promotion
- More competition

**Best Practice:** Publish to **both** if possible
- Nexus: Full-featured PC version
- Bethesda.net: Console-compatible version

---

## Common Misconceptions

### ❌ **"Bethesda.net mods are safer"**
**Reality:** Both platforms moderate content. Nexus has virus scanning and community reporting. Safety depends on downloading from official sources.

### ❌ **"Nexus is only for advanced users"**
**Reality:** Vortex makes modding as easy as Bethesda.net, with more power when you need it.

### ❌ **"Console mods are limited versions of PC mods"**
**Reality:** Often true, but some mods are built specifically for consoles and work great within the platform's constraints.

### ❌ **"You need Premium Nexus account"**
**Reality:** Free accounts work fine. Premium just removes speed limits and ads.

### ❌ **"Bethesda.net mods don't conflict"**
**Reality:** Conflicts happen on both platforms. Load order management is crucial everywhere.

## Migration Between Platforms

### Moving FROM Bethesda.net TO Nexus (PC)

**Why you might migrate:**
