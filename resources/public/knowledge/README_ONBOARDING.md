## 🔒 Privacy Philosophy

**Mossy's Promise:**
- 🔒 Your data is yours - we don't sell or monetize
- 🛡️ Privacy first - permission required before sharing anything
- 💻 Local storage - your computer is the primary location
- 👁️ Transparent - you know exactly what's shared and why

**In Practice:**
- All data stays local by default
- Users must explicitly opt-in to share
- Shared data is anonymized (no personal info)
- Users can change settings anytime
- Users can export or delete everything
