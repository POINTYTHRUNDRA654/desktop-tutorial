# Mossy First-Run Video Tutorial (Script)

## Purpose
A detailed, step-by-step onboarding video that plays before or during the first system scan. It explains the UI, core pages, and first-time setup. The tone is confident, calm, and clear. The pace is slow enough for first-time users.

## Target Length
18 to 25 minutes.

## Visual Style
- Screen capture of the app at 1080p or 1440p.
- Highlight cursor, click targets, and short callouts.
- Optional simple waveform avatar (Mossy face optional). Keep it subtle.

## Chapters and Timing (suggested)
00:00 - 00:45 Intro and value promise
00:45 - 03:00 First launch and safe permissions
03:00 - 05:30 System scan overview

15:30 - 18:30 Where to get help and next steps

## Full Voiceover Script

### 00:00 - 00:45 Intro and value promise
"Welcome to Mossy. In the next few minutes, I will walk you through first-time setup, the system scan, and the core pages you will use every day. If you are brand new to Fallout 4 modding, do not worry. This guide is designed to be simple, clear, and repeatable. You can watch now, or keep this playing while the scan runs."

### 00:45 - 03:00 First launch and safe permissions
"When you open Mossy for the first time, you will see the first-run onboarding. This is where we check your system and learn which tools you have installed. Mossy is permission-first: it will not access files or tools unless you approve it. You can always change these permissions later in Settings.

Before we scan, choose your interface language. You can switch it later, but picking it now keeps the rest of the setup consistent. When you are ready, click Start System Scan."

### 03:00 - 05:30 System scan overview
"The scan looks for modding tools like the Creation Kit, xEdit, Mod Organizer 2, and Blender. It also checks for AI tools that can accelerate workflows. This does not upload your programs anywhere. It is a local scan only.

While this runs, keep watching the tutorial on the right. The scan is safe and you can let it finish in the background. When it completes, you will see a list of recommended tools. Select only the tools you want Mossy to know about or integrate with. This keeps your environment clean and controlled."

### 05:30 - 10:30 Core pages and navigation
"Now let us look at the layout. On the left is the sidebar. This is your main navigation. Every major module lives here. If you ever feel lost, return to the Home page or open the Command Palette with Ctrl plus K.

Key pages you will use the most:

1) The Workshop: This is your scripting and code workspace. It is where you edit Papyrus, run small automations, and generate helpers.

2) The Auditor: This scans assets like NIF meshes and DDS textures. It will show warnings, errors, and suggested fixes.

3) The Assembler: This is your FOMOD packaging tool. Build installers, preview, and export in a guided way.

4) The Cortex: This is your knowledge hub. It provides recommendations, explains conflicts, and can sync with mod organizers.

5) The Vault and Memory Vault: These let you store assets and upload your own documents so Mossy can answer questions from your private notes.

If you are new, start with the Install Wizard, then use the Auditor to verify your first mod files."

### 10:30 - 15:30 First scan workflow and results
"Let us run a basic scan. In the Cortex or Auditor, click Sync and Scan. Mossy will check your mod organizer path, your load order, and look for conflicts or common mistakes. You will see a short status message and a list of recommendations.

If a warning appears, click it. Mossy will explain why it happened and provide a fix. For example, a missing master file or a duplicate FormID. If you are unsure, do not guess. Use the copy button to save the instructions and follow them step by step.

The most important habit: scan after you change your load order, add a new mod, or update a texture pack. This keeps your setup stable."

### 15:30 - 18:30 Where to get help and next steps
"If you need help, the Quick Reference and Knowledge Search pages are built-in. They include step-by-step guides and practical checklists. You can also visit the Community Learning page for curated tutorials.

After onboarding, I recommend three quick actions:
1) Open the Install Wizard and verify your tool paths.
2) Run a basic audit on a small mod to learn the workflow.
3) Save a simple project so your settings persist.

That is it. You are ready to mod with confidence. Keep this tutorial handy and play it again anytime you want a refresher."

## Optional On-Screen Callouts
- "Permission-first: you control what Mossy can access."
- "Use Ctrl+K for the Command Palette."
- "Scan after any major mod change."
- "Auditor for assets, Assembler for packaging, Cortex for knowledge."

## Recording Checklist
- Use 1080p or 1440p capture.
- Speak at 140 to 155 words per minute.
- Show real clicks and real pages.
- Avoid long pauses; add small zooms on key buttons.
- Keep the cursor visible and slow.
