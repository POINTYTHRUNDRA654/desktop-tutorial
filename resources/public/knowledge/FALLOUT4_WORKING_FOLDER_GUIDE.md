# Fallout 4 Working Folder Guide (Mossy)

This guide explains how to add your local Fallout 4 working folder to Mossy so it can build a private, on-device knowledge index. This helps Mossy tutor you with direct references to the game data, scripts, and assets that exist on your machine.

## What This Does

- Lets Mossy index your local Fallout 4 files for Knowledge Search.
- Keeps everything private and on-device (not uploaded or shared).
- Improves modding guidance by referencing the same data you are working with.

## How To Add Your Folder

1. Open External Tools Settings in Mossy.
2. Find the "Fallout 4 Working Folder (Local)" card.
3. Click "Add via Folder Picker" and select your working folder.
4. Open Knowledge Search and click "Build Index".

## Notes

- Each user must select their own folder path.
- Large folders take longer to index.
- If you reorganize files, re-run the Knowledge Search index.

## Example Path

- H:\FO4 WORKING FLODER

## Troubleshooting

- If the picker does not open, you may be running the web build. Use the Electron app.
- If indexing is slow, exclude backups, caches, or large temp folders.
