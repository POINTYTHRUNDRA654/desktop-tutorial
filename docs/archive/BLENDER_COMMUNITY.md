# The Blender Community (Overview)

Blender’s freely available model fostered a large, active user community since the late 1990s. In 2002, community support helped raise €100,000 in seven weeks to make Blender open source under the GNU GPL.

## Independent Sites
- Community forums, blogs, news, and tutorials exist across the web.
- One of the largest forums is Blender Artists — users showcase work, get feedback, and exchange help.

## Getting Support
- Beyond the official manual, support channels include real‑time chat, Q&A sites (e.g., Stack Exchange), and Reddit.
- Studios and organizations can access Enterprise support; Blender Studio provides pipeline documentation and training.
- Found an issue? Please report a bug via the official tracker.

## Development

- Core platforms for developer communication include:
  - Projects platform (issue tracking and planning)
  - Developer Forum
