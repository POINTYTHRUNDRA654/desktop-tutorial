## Brewery System Overview

Learn what the Brewery system is, how it works, and what you can do with it!

### What is the Brewery System?

The Brewery system is a production network similar to agriculture and commerce plots but focused on **crafting consumables** - potions, food items, alcohol, chems, and more.

At its core:
- **Settlers work brewing plots** to create products
- **Products go into settlement inventory** automatically
- **Player can use/sell these products** for profit, healing, or gameplay benefits

### Why Add Breweries?

**For Players:**
- New way to generate income (sell brewed goods)
- Access to unique potions and items
- Settlement specialization (farming vs. brewing economy)
- Gameplay variety and role-playing options

**For Creators:**
- Entirely new recipe system to design with
- Integration with supply agreements
- Department synergy opportunities
- Community interest in consumable production

### How Breweries Work

#### Basic Workflow

1. **Settler assigned to Brewery plot** in settlement
2. **Plot production runs in background** (in-game time-based)
3. **Items produced and added to settlement inventory**
4. **Player uses or sells items** as needed

#### Requirements

**Plot Level Requirements:**
- Level 1 Brewery: Can produce basic recipes
- Level 2 Brewery: Can produce intermediate recipes  
- Level 3 Brewery: Can produce advanced recipes
- Level 4 Brewery: Can produce rare recipes

**Settler Requirements:**
- Each recipe has suggested settler count (can override)
- Some recipes require specific skills (Alchemy, Cooking, etc.)
- Assigning more settlers increases production rate

**Resource Requirements:**
- Ingredients must be in settlement inventory
- Some recipes use community stash ingredients
- Supply agreements can auto-provide ingredients

#### Production Mechanics

**Production Time:**
- Most recipes take 24-72 in-game hours
- Some rare recipes take up to 1 week
- Real-time mode available for testing

**Batch Size:**
- Most recipes produce 1-5 units per batch
- Rare recipes might produce 1-2 units
- Player can queue multiple batches

**Storage:**
- Products go into settlement inventory
- No storage limit (settlement container system)
- Player can retrieve anytime

### Accessing Brewery Features

#### Step 2: Construct Brewery Plot

Using workshop:
1. In build mode, place **Brewery Plot** from **Special** category
2. Snap to flat ground if possible (reduces visual clipping)
3. Position in sheltered area if weather matters to you
4. Place nearby resource containers for easy access

**Visual Customization:**
- Brewery plots have modular design
- Add walls, roof, lights nearby
- Suggest thematic decoration (barrels, bottles, signs)

#### Step 3: Assign Settler

1. Open holotape > Settlers tab
2. Select settlement with new brewery
3. Choose settler to assign
4. Scroll down to **Brewery Section**
5. Select **Level 1 Brewery**
6. Click assign

**Settler Considerations:**
- Young settlers more efficient
- Settlers with Alchemy skill bonus (if available)
- Avoid assigning settlers needed for critical jobs

#### Step 4: Queue First Recipe

1. Open holotape > Settlers > Select brewery settler
2. Look for **Available Recipes**
3. Select **Basic Mead** (Level 1, good starter)
4. Check ingredients:
   - Honey (likely have some)
   - Purified Water (easy to obtain)
   - Yeast (common ingredient)
5. Confirm you have ingredients in settlement inventory
6. Click **Queue Recipe** to start production

#### Step 5: Monitor Production

**In-Game Time:**
- Production happens in background
- Time varies by recipe (24-120 hours)
- Can speed up by sleeping past due date

**Check Status:**
1. Open holotape again > Check settler assignment
2. See countdown timer for current recipe
3. See queued recipes below

**Retrieve Products:**
