# Free Software and the GPL (Blender Context)

Free software means “free as in freedom,” not necessarily zero cost. Under the GNU General Public License (GPL), users have broad rights and responsibilities that protect those freedoms.

## Your Rights under the GPL
- Use: run the program for any purpose.
- Study/Modify: access and change the source code.
- Share: copy and distribute the program.
- Improve/Publish: release your modified versions.

## Your Responsibilities when Distributing
- Include the GPL: provide the license so recipients know their rights.
- Provide Source: include or make source freely available.
- License Modifications: release changes under the GPL (or a compatible license).
- No Additional Restrictions: you cannot convert GPL software into proprietary software or add constraints beyond the GPL.

## Blender Specifics
- Blender itself is GPL‑licensed.
- Your artwork (assets, renders, .blend files) is NOT covered by the GPL; see Blender’s license notes for details.
