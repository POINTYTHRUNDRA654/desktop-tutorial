# Project Status (canonical)

This file is the single source of truth for implementation/status summaries. It replaces scattered status files and links to archived historical notes.

## Current status
- See `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` for the active implementation details and checklist.
- Active features & progress: refer to `COMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` and `ENHANCEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`.

## Historical logs & archived status
- Old session notes and legacy summaries moved to `/docs/archive/` (e.g., `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_OLD.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_SESSION_GUIDE.md`, `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`).

---
Maintainers: keep `PROJECT_STATUS.md` updated; archive older, one-off status files into `/docs/archive/` rather than keeping many files in the repo root.
