## 🎯 How It Works

### First-Time User Flow
```
1. Download & Launch Mossy
2. See MossyOnboarding modal (can't dismiss)
3. Step 1: Read welcome message
4. Step 2: Select your tools (Creation Kit? Blender? xEdit?)
5. Step 3: Choose privacy settings (all OFF by default)
   - Want to help community? Turn ON knowledge sharing
   - Want to be completely private? Leave everything OFF
6. Step 4: Confirm setup
7. App loads normally
8. User starts using Mossy
```

### Accessing Privacy Settings Later
```

2. View current configuration
3. Toggle any setting on/off
4. See "Saving..." then "Saved"
5. Changes take effect immediately
6. Can export data or delete everything
```

### How Knowledge Sharing Works
```
User writes script code
       ↓
(if user enabled "Share Script Patterns")
       ↓
Mossy extracts pattern: "Event listeners improve performance"
       ↓
Anonymizer removes: project name, file path, personal details
       ↓
Shared pattern: "Pattern: Event listener registration is 20% faster"
       ↓
Community database gets it
       ↓
All Mossy users benefit from the technique
       
(User's actual code and project NEVER shared)
(Personal info NEVER shared)
(User can turn it off anytime)
```
